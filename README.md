Find a Buddy!

This is a basic dating app, it quizes the user,  creates a profile with their answers, stores it in the database and the finds the closest match to those based on the answers to the questionaire.

simple enough. ran into *some* trouble with the new user creation.

This app utilizes an API routing, and something closer to a full stack structure.
